This was something I had to make very quickly.  We had to swap out drives on a bunch of servers and our software has dependecies on a certain directory structure, ownership, and permissions.I wrote check_directory_v1.sh quickly to get the job done.

One of the ways that I improve my skillsets is to go back and learn how to do something better.  This is where I incorporate check_directory_v2.sh.  I created a function to do all the work and passed it 3 parameters.  Much more efficient and just better code.
